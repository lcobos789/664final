# 664final
This concerns the research and methodology concerning the final project for INFO-664: Programming for Cultural Heritage. The task at hand was to use three different sources to compile datasets that prove or disprove a question. My background is in archives and ephemera conservation and preservation, so I wanted to focus my search in the GLAM field. With a hopeful future in museums and art history, I wanted to use museum datasets so I could get accustomed with the nomenclature and jargon in the datasets. So for this project, I chose to explore the inclusivity in some of the western worldâ€™s biggest and most popular museums.
